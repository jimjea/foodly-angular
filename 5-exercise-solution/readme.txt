 **** Exercise 5: Routing with ui-router ****


Outcome: Understand how routing and states are implemented in angularjs.

1.  Define a config for the angular-books app.
	Inject the ui.router dependency into the 
	angular-books module. Pass in the stateProvider
	and the urlRouterProvider.

2.	Define two states in the config (book1 & book2).

3.	Assign url route, define an inline template for both states.

4.  Create a "BookController" for the angular-books app.

5.	In the "BookController" add a function 'goToBook2'
	to the controller's scope object.

6.  Bind "BookController" to the (book1) state template.

7. 	Trigger the 'goToBook2' method from ng-click binding
	in the (book1) state template
