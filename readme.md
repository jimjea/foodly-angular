Welcome to the AOWP Angular Academy!

This is the project directory.

*1-exercise-solution ... 11-exercise-solution* contain a solution to the practical exercises in their respective folders.
Each Exercise Folder contains a brief procedural description as well as outcomes of the exercise in a readme file.

*Template* folder contains a blank template that can be copy and pasted as boilerplate to get you started for each of the exercises.

*Final* folder contains an implementation version of the Capstone Project. It is a fully functioning angular application with multiple tenants.

We hope you find these resources particularly helpful on your path to Angular expertise.

Thanks, Good Luck, & Happy Learning!
